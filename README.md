# __Reinforcement Learning Project__


## __Introduction__
  RL_Intro.ipynb is an introduction to the basic RL concepts and an implementation of the Cartpole Environment.

## __Project 1 - Breakout__
  In this project we implement the Breakout Environment based on the Atari game.

## __Project 2 - Self Driving__
  Implementation of CarRacing Environment where a car has to stay inside a race track.
 
## __Project 3 - Custom Environment__
  In this project we create a custom environment for a shower. Our agent must learn to keep the temperature in an optimal range.
